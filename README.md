# Employee Management System

This Employee Management System is implemented using JavaScript classes, demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system includes classes for `Employee`, `Manager`, and `Department`. Employees have details like name, position, salary, and department. The `Department` class stores employees, calculates total salaries, and handles manager bonuses. Managers inherit from the Employee class with an added bonus property.

The system supports adding employees to departments and calculating total salaries for both regular employees and managers. It is designed to be scalable for handling multiple departments and employees.
